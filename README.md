# FeastChoice

This project is made to answer the question: "What do we eat today?"

## Motivation

I got sick and tired always asking from my wife what do we eat next week, while we were in the grocery store.

Normal families have 10-30 meals they interchange in their normal routine life, with minor twists. I wanted to automate the process to the point I can just click a button and go to the grocery store. 

I also wanted an app that gives and scales me 2-3 meals for each week. Also the meals must last whole week, and we had a problem the meals weren't enough for the whole week.

So FeastChoice began.
